# Lending Club Case Study

## General Information
- The main purpose of this project is to understand and do Exploratory Data Analysis. The project is based on a the loan data of a Consumer Finance company. The objective is to understand the data, analyse the data and find the driving factors to determine whether a loan should be approved or not, and thereby minimise the risk of financial loss and business loss
- A Consumer Finance Company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
   - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
   - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The dataset that has been used in this project is the loan data which includes around 40k loans issued during the period of 2007 to 2011.

* The employees with 0-1 year and 10 –10+years,followed by 7,8 years experience have more charged off loans and the common pattern bewteen them is higher mean value of loan on smaller business.
* The Median of the annual income is increasing as the experince increase ,the mean annual income of employes  who  defaults loan is less when compared to the employess who fully paid the loan
