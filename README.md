# Lending Club Case Study

## General Information
- The main purpose of this project is to understand and do Exploratory Data Analysis. The project is based on a the loan data of a Consumer Finance company. The objective is to understand the data, analyse the data and find the driving factors to determine whether a loan should be approved or not, and thereby minimise the risk of financial loss and business loss
- A Consumer Finance Company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
   - If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
   - If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- The dataset that has been used in this project is the loan data which includes around 40k loans issued during the period of 2007 to 2011.

## Observations and Conclusions

* It is highly risky to lend loans to applicants in the 0-20K annual income range
* As the interest rates increases, the chances of charge off increases, hence the company should formulate more loan plans with lesser interest rates
* Small Business Purpose loan lenders show high tendency for defaulting and hence it should be considered as risky category
* Short term loans should be encouraged as such loans have lesser interest rates which ensures the loan is Fully Paid
* Grade A loans should be encouraged as such loans have lesser interest rates which ensures the loan is Fully Paid. The order of preference should be Grade A, B, C, D, E, F and G
* It’s highly risky to lend loans to applicants who has previous bankruptcy record history or public derogatory records. The more the number of records, the higher the risk
